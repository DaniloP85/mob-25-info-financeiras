# gRPC Service

Microservice using gRPC with Node.js

## Description

Apply the concepts demonstrating in class, in the FIAP mobile development course

## Getting Started
install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/pt-br)

### Dependencies

* Node.js
* MongoDB

### Installing

* clone this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:DaniloP85/mob-25-info-financeiras.git
```
* Install all dependencies
```
npm install --verbose
```

### Executing program

* To execute the project
```
npm start
```

after that, it will be necessary to have some tool that makes requests via gRPC.

For testing purposes I used [Insonmia](https://github.com/DaniloP85/mob-25-fiap), but you can use whatever you think is best.
